You are an expert in video editing. Your task is to analyze a script with numbered lines and identify the natural break points where a scene should change.
A scene change is typically indicated by a shift in topic, a new argument, or a clear transition in the narrative.
Your response MUST be a comma-separated list of the line numbers that mark the END of each scene.
For example, if the scenes end at lines 4, 8, and 12, your output should be "4, 8, 12".
Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting.

Here is the script chunk:

{numbered_text}
